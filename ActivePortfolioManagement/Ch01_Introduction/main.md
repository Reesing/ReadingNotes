# Chapter01 Introduction

## Origin

- Quantitative active management is a cousin of the modern financial economics.
- The book looks to the academy for structure and insight, **NOT for solutions**.
- **Ingredients for success** in active management:
    - **a recognition of the challenge: it is difficult**.
    - it is an economic investigation: 
        + we can **never repeat an experiment**, and
        + we actually **affect the transaction prices**.

## Perspective

- The book's **goal** is to provide a structured approach for active investment management, including
    - researching ideas,
    - forecasting exceptional returns,
    - constructing and implementing portfolios,
    - observing and refining portfolios' performance,
    - a set of strategic concepts and rules of thumb.

## Strategic Overview

- Quantitative Active Management v.s. Modern Portfolio Theory
    - QAM has the power and structure of MPT, but without legitimacy.
    - QAM borrows some tools from economics.
    - QAM separates the risk forecasting from return forecasting.
        - This is where professionals are far ahead of academics.
        - QAM provides standard and unbiased estimates of investment risk.

- Moving from the economic and textbook notion of **the market** to the more operational notion of **a benchmark**.

- The book relates **portfolios** to **return forecasts** or **asset characteristics**.

- Some key concepts:
    - **residual return** = the return that is uncorrelated with the benchmark return.
    - **IR** = **information ratio** = expected annual residual return / annual volatility of reidual return
        - IR defines the **opportunities** available to the active manager.
    - **risk-adjusted expected return** / **value-added** = residual return - a quadratic penalty on risidual risk
        - it shows **preferences**.
        - ***Choosing investment opportunities depends on preferences.***
        - it leads to **indifferent curves**.
    - certainty equivalent

- ***When preferences confront opportunities, investment choices are made.***

- [The highest value-added *achievable*] is proportional to [the square of IR].

- Where are **the sources of investment opportunity**?
    - ability to forecast each asset's residual return -> **IC**
        - **IC** = Information Coefficient = correlation between the forecasts and the eventual returns.
        - IC measures **forecasting ability**.
    - \# times per year to use out skill-> **breadth**

- The Fundamental Law:

- Betting on the market's direction does not provide much breadth -> lack of enthusiasm for benchmark timing strategies.

- Active management is **forecasting**.
    - Forecasting : **raw signals of asset returns** -> **refined forecasts**
    - Basic insight : relate [ **a standardized (zero mean and unit standard deviation) score** ] to [ **a forecast of residual return (an alpha)** ].

- The book does not guarantee success in investment management. It only helps to process the garbage more effectively.
